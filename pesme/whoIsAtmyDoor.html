    <h1>Who is at my door</h1>
    <pre>
        He said, “Who is at my door?”
        I said, “Your humble servant.”
        He said, “What business do you have?”
        I said, “To greet you, oh Lord.”
        
        He said, “How long will you journey on?”
        I said, “Until you stop me.”
        He said, “How long will you boil in the fire?”
        I said, “Until I am pure.
        
        This is my oath of love.
        For the sake of love
        I gave up wealth and position.”
        
        He said, “You have pleaded your case
        but you have no witness.”
        I said, “My tears are my witness;
        the pallor of my face is my proof.”
        He said, “Your witness has no credibility;
        your eyes are too wet to see.”
        I said, “By the splendor of your justice
        my eyes are clear and faultless.”
        
        He said, “What do you seek?”
        I said, “To have you as my constant friend.”
        He said, “What do you want from me?”
        I said, “Your abundant grace.”
        
        He said, “Who was your companion on the journey?”
        I said, “The thought of you, O King.”
        He said, “What called you here?”
        I said, “The fragrance of your wine.”
        
        He said, “What brings you the most fulfillment?”
        I said, “The company of the Emperor.”
        He said, “What do you find there?”
        I said, “A hundred miracles.”
        He said, “Why is the palace deserted?”
        I said, “They all fear the thief.”
        He said, “Who is the thief?”
        I said, “The one who keeps me from you.
        
        He said, “Where is there safety?”
        I said, “In service and renunciation.”
        He said, “What is there to renounce?”
        I said, “The hope of salvation.”
        
        He said, “Where is there calamity?”
        I said, “In the presence of your love.”
        He said, “How do you benefit from this life?”
        I said, “By being true to myself.”
        
        Now it is time for silence.
        If I told you about His true essence
        You would fly from your self and be gone,
        and neither door nor roof could hold you back!
