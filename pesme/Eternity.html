<h1>Eternity</h1>

<pre>
    All through eternity

    Beauty unveils His exquisite form
    
    in the solitude of nothingness;
    
    He holds a mirror to His Face
    
    and beholds His own beauty.
    
    he is the knower and the known,
    
    the seer and the seen;
    
    No eye but His own
    
    has ever looked upon this Universe.
    
    His every quality finds an expression:
    
    Eternity becomes the verdant field of Time and Space;
    
    Love, the life-giving garden of this world.
    
    Every branch and leaf and fruit
    
    Reveals an aspect of His perfection-
    
    They cypress give hint of His majesty,
    
    The rose gives tidings of His beauty.
    
    Whenever Beauty looks,
    
    Love is also there;
    
    Whenever beauty shows a rosy cheek
    
    Love lights Her fire from that flame.
    
    When beauty dwells in the dark folds of night
    
    Love comes and finds a heart
    
    entangled in tresses.
    
    Beauty and Love are as body and soul.
    
    Beauty is the mine, Love is the diamond.
    
    They have together
    
    since the beginning of time-
    
    Side by side, step by step.
    
    I swear, since seeing Your face,
    
    the whole world is fraud and fantasy
    
    The garden is bewildered as to what is leaf
    
    or blossom. The distracted birds
    
    canâ€™t distinguish the birdseed from the snare.
    
    A house of love with no limits,
    
    a presence more beautiful than venus or the moon,
    
    a beauty whose image fills the mirror of the heart.
