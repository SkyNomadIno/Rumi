    <h1>The Lover is always alone</h1>
    <pre>
The intellectual is always showing off,

the lover is always getting lost.

The intellectual runs away.

afraid of drowning;

the whole business of love

is to drown in the sea.

Intellectuals plan their repose;

lovers are ashamed to rest.

The lover is always alone.

even surrounded by people;

like water and oil, he remains apart.

The man who goes to the trouble

of giving advice to a lover

get nothing. Heâ€™s mocked by passion.

Love is like musk. It attracts attention.

Love is a tree, and the lovers are its shade.
    </pre>
