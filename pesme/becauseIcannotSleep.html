    <h1>Because I cannot sleep</h1>
    <pre>
       Because I cannot sleep
        I make music at night.
        I am troubled by the one
        whose face e has the color of spring flowers.
        I have neither sleep nor patience,
        neither a god reputation nor disgrace.
        A thousand robes of wisdom are gone.
        All my good manners have moved a thousand miles away.
        The heart and the mind are left angry with each other.
        The starts and the moon are envious of each other.
        Because of this alienation the physical universe
        is getting tighter and tighter.
        The moon says, “How long will I remain
        suspended without a sun?”
        Without Love’s jewel inside of me,
        let the bazaar of my existence by destroyed stone by stone.
        O Love, You who have been called by a thousand names,
        You who know how to pour the wine
        into the chalice of the body,
        You who give culture to a thousand cultures,
        You who are faceless but have a thousand faces,
        O Love, You who shape the faces
        of Turks, Europeans, and Zanzibaris,
        give me a glass from Your bottle,
        or a handful of bheng from Your Branch.
        Remove the cork once more.
        The we’ll see a thousand chiefs prostrate themselves,
        and a circle of ecstatic troubadours will play.
        Then the addict will be breed of craving.
        and will be resurrected,
        and stand in awe till Judgement Day.</pre>
</body>
