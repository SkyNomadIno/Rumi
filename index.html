                <p>Jalaluddin Rumi, commonly known as Rumi, was a 13th-century Persian poet, Islamic scholar, and Sufi mystic. He was born on September 30, 1207, in the city of Balkh, which is now part of Afghanistan, and died on December 17, 1273, in Konya, Turkey.</p>
            
                <p>Rumi's family fled the Mongol invasion of Central Asia and eventually settled in Konya, where his father became a prominent scholar and religious figure. Rumi followed in his father's footsteps and became a renowned Islamic scholar and jurist. However, at the age of 37, he met a wandering mystic named Shams al-Din, who had a profound impact on his life and led him to devote himself to Sufism.</p>
                    
               
                    
                <p>Rumi's teachings emphasize the importance of love, compassion, and self-awareness in attaining spiritual enlightenment. He believed that all religions were different paths to the same truth and encouraged his followers to seek God through prayer, meditation, and service to others.</p>
                    
                <p>Rumi's influence has spread far beyond his native Persia and his teachings have been embraced by people of all faiths and cultures. His poetry has been translated into many languages and continues to be read and studied around the world. Rumi's legacy also includes the Mevlevi Order, a Sufi order founded by his followers that is known for its whirling dervishes, who perform a meditative dance as a form of worship.</p>

<h2>Shams</h2>

<p>Shams al-Din Mohammad, also known as Shams of Tabriz, was a Persian Sufi mystic and spiritual teacher who played a significant role in the life of Rumi. Shams and Rumi met in Konya, Turkey, in 1244, and their close friendship and spiritual bond had a profound impact on Rumi's life and poetry.

    Shams was a controversial figure in his time, and his teachings challenged the traditional religious and social norms of his society. He believed in the power of love and the direct experience of God, rather than relying on dogma and religious authority.
    
    Shams and Rumi spent many months together, engaging in deep conversations and spiritual practices. According to legend, they even disappeared together for several weeks, during which time they were said to have experienced a deep spiritual union.
    
    After Shams' mysterious disappearance, Rumi went through a period of intense grief and longing for his friend, which is reflected in much of his later poetry. The teachings and influence of Shams are also evident in Rumi's poetry, which often explores themes of love, unity, and the search for the divine.
    
    Shams al-Din is remembered as a spiritual teacher and guide who helped to shape the life and work of one of the most beloved poets in history. His legacy continues to inspire seekers of truth and lovers of poetry around the world.</p>
